Overview
--------

*divination* is a python package that exposes a simple interface for transacting 
with physical memory and IO space - cross platform (currently Windows10 and Linux).

IO and physical memory regions are mapped into the python usermode process and are 
transacted directly with the assistance of ctypes.

To function, the module requires a resident kernel-mode driver.

Features
--------

* Reading PCI configuration space
* Reading MSRs (writing MSRs - TODO)
* Mapping and RW from/to IO regions
* Mapping and RW from/to physical memory regions (Linux-only - TODO Windows)

Dependencies
------------

* (Windows) pywin32
* (Linux) <none>

Installation
------------

Python module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The python module is available off PyPI:

    pip3 install divination

Kernel module (Windows)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The KMDF driver can be built by installing VS, SDK + WDK and 
running msbuild under the `driver/win <driver/win>`_ directory from within the VS Developer 
Command Prompt.

Please **do not (non-test-)sign** this kernel module; we do not want to further enable attackers!
Unless a restrictive DeviceGuard policy is employed, enabling testsigning should be sufficient to allow the driver to run:

    bcdedit /set testsigning on ; shutdown -f -t 0 -r

Kernel module (Linux)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Linux kernel module can be built by running make under the `driver/linux <driver/linux>`_ directory.
The usual prerequisite dependencies (kernel headers, gcc, etc.) will need to be installed.

Usage
-----

There are currently 3 classes available: PciDevice, Msr and MemoryObject. 
Examples follow for usage of each.

* PciDevice(bus, device, function)

    >>> amd_lpc = PciDevice(0, 0x14, 3)     # LPC Bridge @ D14F3
    >>> hexdump.hexdump(amd_lpc.read_cfg())
